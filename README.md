# Security Considerations ðŸ”’

## Prompt Injection / Tool Poisoning
Prompt Injection or Tool Poisoning happens when someone deliberately manipulates an MCP tool by embedding malicious prompts into function names, descriptions, or error messages. This can cause the tool to execute unintended commands or reveal sensitive information.

## Rug-Pull
A Rug-Pull occurs when a tool or project initially appears legitimate and harmless. However, a later update from the developer can change its behavior, potentially allowing data to be accessed or files to be created without the user's consent. This issue originates from the developer, not from the protocol or platform itself.

## General Note
While the MCP protocol itself is relatively safe and does not inherently pose major security risks, the actual security of a tool depends heavily on how it is implemented and maintained. Developers must handle inputs carefully, validate all data, and implement proper access controls to prevent vulnerabilities.
