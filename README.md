## Available Tools ðŸ§°

- **Count_parameters** : Just counts parameters

## Possible extensions

- Make it possible to extrude, shell, revolve (Pretty hard to select the right body and side if many bodies are involved)
- For show I could implement cameramovement after a prompt
  

# Security ConsiderationsðŸ”’

- **Prompt Injection / Tool Poisoning**  
  - Someone can manipulate the MCP tool on purpose.  
  - Malicious prompts can be put into function names, descriptions, or error messages.  
  - This can make the tool do things it shouldn't, like reveal data.

- **Rug-Pull**  
  - The tool looks safe at first.  
  - Later updates from the developer can change it.  
  - It might access your data or create files without permission.  
  - The risk comes from the developer, not the protocol.

- **General Note**  
  - The MCP protocol itself is mostly safe.  
  - The real security depends on how the tool is built and used.  
  - Developers should check inputs, validate data, and add access controls.
 

# Security Considerations in this Project
  - This project runs locally on your machine.
  - Currently, it uses plain HTTP for communication. This is fine for local use, but HTTP is unencrypted and could be insecure if exposed to a network.
  - Switching to HTTPS would make communication more secure and follow best practices.
  - Only trusted scripts and inputs should be used to avoid potential issues.
